# BankingManagementSystemwithFilling
I have tried to make a Banking Management System using Masm (Assembeler) and by using Irvine32 library.
Tis Management system also include Filing.
One can create a user and save its information in the file.
If you want to check the user info you can read from the file
If user and password match 
The information would be shown.
